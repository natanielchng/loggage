# Loggage
_Automatically screenshot your CLI logs!_

#### ✨ Why use this tool?
- <mark>Speed up documentation tasks</mark> -- just copy and paste the generated screenshots
- <mark>Quickly review executed commands and output in a CLI session</mark>
- <mark>Keep your environment data private</mark> -- this tool runs locally in your browser; sensitive log data is not sent elsewhere

#### 🗓️ Planned Features
- Upload and process multiple log files
- Separate dropdown sections for extracted text and generated images

#### 👾 Bugs
- Especially long sections of text create corrupted images
- Entering a search pattern that really does not exist in the log file does not have error handling (just shows loading symbol)
- Resizing the browser affects the generated image size and text layout
